Info::dumpSDO_PCMetadata:
  This used to dump schema info.  It doesn't anymore.  What should it do?
BufferedInfocation::begin:
  This uses huge buffers.  Can we do something more sensible?
oci::Reader
  Do we need a function to grab metadata?
  Do we need serializePipeline support?
oci::Writer::createPcEntry:
  Why do we set the pc_id value into the options (at the end?)  I don't thing
  we ever use the value after we set it into the options.  Investigate.
oci::Writer::createSDOEntry:
  Allow override of geographic bounds
oci::Block::~Block
  Figure out why destroying the extent causes a segfault
las::Writer::processOptions:
  Need to move all the options to processOptions.
las::Writer::ready:
  Fix or properly comment the strange logic on global_encoding_data when
  the size is 4 or 8 (what's the point of writing something that doesn't fit?)
kernel::Info::dump
  Handle show m_showSchema
  Handle m_showSDOPCMetaata
kernel::Diff::execute
  Output dimensions when source and candidate context sizes don't match.
PointBuffer::resolveType
  Reconsider non-float -> float in the case of large ints.  Should we perhaps
  go non-float -> double?  Probably should make a matrix.
